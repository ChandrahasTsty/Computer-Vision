# Computer-Vision
This repository has files needed for using jpeg library written in C for Computer Vision/Image processing applications, these files are part of my work for Summer Project'16
Most of these files require jpeg-library folder to be present in the same directory, To do that visit this link http://www.ijg.org/files/jpegsr9b.zip, download & unzip and place them in the same directory,The codes I have written will work only Unix based Systems(code may work on Mac), However to maked it work on other operating systems much work is not needed.
