This repository has the code files that I created for Implementation of Defogging Image Processing Algorithm. This project is completely made in C & using this project doesn't require any other files than the files& folders in this repository.

Most of these codes require jpeg-library folder to be present in the same directory,(which was already there in this repo). I downloaded it from this link http://www.ijg.org/files/jpegsr9b.zip.
